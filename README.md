# color_correction
**Color correction** is a the process of converting RAW RGB pixel values of
digital cameras to a standard color space such as CIE XYZ.

This is my implementation of color correction algorithms mentioned by
[this article](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/9/10/214).

Algorithms are located in [color_correction folder](color_correction/).

Perfomance of these methods available in [this notebook](results.ipynb).
